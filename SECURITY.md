# 🔐 SECURITY NOTICE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Commit Credentials to Public Repositories!

This project now uses **environment variables** to keep your email credentials secure. Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ What's Safe to Commit:
- `.env.example` - Template file without real credentials
- `send_email.php` - Uses environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
- `test_email.php` - Uses environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
- All other project files

### ❌ What Should NEVER be Committed:
- `.env` - Contains your actual credentials
- Any file with hardcoded passwords or API keys

### 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented:

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data moved to `.env` file
2. **Git Protection**: `.env` file included in `.gitignore`
3. **Template System**: `.env.example` provides setup guidance
4. **Code Security**: PHP files only reference environment variables

### 🔧 How It Works Now:

Instead of:
```php
$mail->Username = 'aventryxsystems@gmail.com';        // ❌ EXPOSED
$mail->Password = 'otyfsgppavhvhkfo';                // ❌ EXPOSED
```

We now use:
```php
$mail->Username = $_ENV['SMTP_USERNAME'];             // ✅ SECURE
$mail->Password = $_ENV['SMTP_PASSWORD'];             // ✅ SECURE
```

### 📋 Setup Checklist for New Environments:

1. ✅ Clone the repository
2. ✅ Run `composer install`
3. ✅ Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. ✅ Edit `.env` with your actual credentials
5. ✅ Test the contact form
6. ✅ Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`

### 🚨 If Credentials Were Already Exposed:

If your credentials were previously committed to a public repository:

1. **Change your Gmail App Password immediately**
2. **Remove the repository history** (or create a new repository)
3. **Verify no one has accessed your email account**

### 💡 Best Practices Going Forward:

- **Always use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Check `.gitignore`** before committing
- **Use different credentials** for development and production
- **Regularly rotate passwords** and API keys
- **Never share `.env` files** in chat, email, or documentation

**Remember**: The security of your application is only as strong as your weakest credential. Keep them safe! 🔒
