# Service Inquiry Forms

## Overview
Each service modal now includes a dedicated inquiry form that allows potential clients to request quotes directly with service-specific context.

## Features

### ðŸ“‹ Form Fields

**Required Fields:**
- **Full Name** - Client's full name
- **Email Address** - For sending quotes and communication
- **Project Details** - Detailed description of what they need

**Optional Fields:**
- **Phone Number** - Alternative contact method
- **Preferred Timeline** - Helps prioritize and schedule work
  - Urgent (1-2 days)
  - Normal (3-7 days)
  - Flexible (1-2 weeks)
  - No rush

**Auto-filled:**
- **Service Requested** - Automatically populated based on which service modal was opened

## How It Works

### 1. User Journey
1. User browses services section
2. Clicks on a service card
3. Service modal opens with details
4. Scrolls down to see the "Request a Quote" form
5. Fills out the form with their information
6. Submits the inquiry

### 2. Form Submission
- Validates required fields
- Sends data to Formspree endpoint: `https://formspree.io/f/xeopjbwb`
- Shows loading state while sending
- Displays success/error notification
- Closes modal on success
- Falls back to mailto if Formspree fails

### 3. Email Format
When submitted, you'll receive an email with subject:
```
Service Inquiry: [Service Name] - [Client Name]
```

Email content includes:
- Service requested
- Client name
- Client email
- Phone number (if provided)
- Preferred timeline
- Detailed project description

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Functions
- `submitServiceForm()` - Handles form validation and submission
- `sendServiceInquiry()` - Sends data to Formspree
- `resetServiceForm()` - Clears form after submission
- `openServiceModal(serviceId)` - Auto-fills service name

### State Management
```javascript
serviceForm: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    service: '',        // Auto-filled
    details: '',
    preferredTimeline: '',
    sending: false
}
```

### Validation
- Client-side validation for required fields
- Email format validation (HTML5)
- Form disabled while sending to prevent double submission

Details:
I have a 500GB external hard drive that was accidentally formatted. 
It contained important family photos and work documents from the past 
5 years. The drive is still recognized by my computer but shows as 
empty. I stopped using it immediately after realizing what happened. 
Can you help recover the data?
```
