# Security Cleanup - PHPMailer Removal

## Date: October 25, 2025

### Issue
PHPMailer integration was removed from the repository due to credential exposure concerns.

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Files Removed
- ✅ `docs/.env` - Environment file with credentials (was NOT in git history)
- ✅ `docs/.env.example` - Example environment file
- ✅ `docs/send_email.php` - PHPMailer email handler
- ✅ `docs/test_email.php` - Email testing script
- ✅ `docs/debug_env.php` - Environment debugging script
- ✅ `docs/composer.json` - Composer dependencies
- ✅ `docs/vendor/` - All PHP dependencies including PHPMailer

#### 2. Code Updated
- ✅ `docs/script.js` - Removed PHP endpoint call, now uses mailto: link directly

#### 3. Verification
- ✅ `.env` was never committed to git (confirmed via git history)
- ✅ `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files
- ✅ All PHPMailer-related code removed

### Exposed Credentials (ACTION REQUIRED)
⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**

The following credentials were found in the local `.env` file:
- Email: `aventryxsystems@gmail.com`
- App Password: `otyfsgppavhvhkfo`

**You MUST:**
1. ✅ Change the password for `aventryxsystems@gmail.com`
2. ✅ Revoke the app password `otyfsgppavhvhkfo` in Google Account settings
3. ✅ Review your Google Account security settings for any unauthorized access
4. ✅ Check account activity logs for suspicious logins
5. ✅ Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

### Current Contact Form Behavior
The portfolio now uses a simple mailto: link that opens the visitor's default email client. This is:
- ✅ More secure (no server-side credentials)
- ✅ Privacy-friendly (no third-party email services)
- ✅ Works on GitHub Pages without backend requirements
- ⚠️ Requires visitors to have an email client configured

### Alternative Solutions (Future)
If you want to re-implement form submissions, consider:
1. **Formspree** - Free tier available, no backend needed
2. **Netlify Forms** - If you migrate to Netlify
3. **EmailJS** - Client-side email sending
4. **Web3Forms** - Simple API-based form handling
5. **Contact form services** - Services like Form.io, FormBackend

### Notes
- The `.env` file was properly excluded by `.gitignore` and never made it to the repository
- No sensitive data was committed to git history
- The exposure risk is limited to the local development environment
- However, the password should still be changed as a precaution

---
**Remember:** Never commit `.env` files or any files containing credentials to version control!
